The boot camp sessions were of great use, it utilised my time correct way. I got to learn many new concepts through these sessions like Python,git,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Linear regression etc. I really enjoyed learning all these new concepts.
Overall the boot camp was very effective and utilised my time in a very appropriate manner and made me familiar with some more python libraries.
