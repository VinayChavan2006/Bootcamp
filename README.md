## My Review
<br>
The evening sessions added a spiritual essence to my day. It motivated me to balance both the spiritual life as well as the academic life also it made me realise the Struggles of Srila Prabhupad to spread the spirituality all across the world, This was very inspiring for me.Learning or working in a spiritual environment makes me feel that all my deeds are offered to Lord Krishna.Overall the bootcamp helped me gain knowledge of various libraries.
