Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n","\n","The first step in creating a class is giving it a name. In this notebook, we will create two classes: Circle and Rectangle. We need to determine all the data that make up that class, which we call <em>attributes</em>. Think about this step as creating a blue print that we will use to create objects. In figure 1 we see two classes, Circle and Rectangle. Each has their attributes, which are variables. The class Circle has the attribute radius and color, while the Rectangle class has the attribute height, width and color. Let’s use the visual examples of these shapes before we get to the code, as this will help you get accustomed to the vocabulary.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"817dbcf7-1ae5-4b49-9257-1c3828330a50","metadata":{},"source":["<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/ClassesClass.png\" width=\"500\">\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"106f38e2-5bcf-4082-9061-f5cb480dbe47","metadata":{},"source":["<i>Figure 1: Classes circle and rectangle, and each has their own attributes.
